# Chrispy
A keylogger that transmits data remotely built for my networks class

I built this in a highly controlled test environment. When I built this about 5 years back, virustotal.com told me that 28/32 engines did not detect this. However, today, even GMail blocks it, so I am comfortable with releasing the source code. This uses Raw Input.

I lost the code to the server side. If I find it, I will update this repo.
